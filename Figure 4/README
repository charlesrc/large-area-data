# Figure 4 â€“ Experimental and Theoretical Data

This folder contains all data and scripts necessary to reproduce Figure 4 of the project. Figure 4 compares experimental measurements of surface morphology and optical response with theoretical predictions.

## Folder structure

- AFM/
  - Processed Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) surface data.
- Experiment/
  - Raw and processed experimental measurements.
- Theory/
  - Theoretical simulation results.
- effective-depth.ipynb
  - Jupyter Notebook for post-processing depth-related data.
- yagce.csv
  - Optical constants (n, k) for Cerium-doped Yttrium Aluminum Garnet (Ce:YAG).

## File descriptions

### AFM/
- `processed_afm_data.mat`: MATLAB `.mat` file containing processed AFM topography data.

### Experiment/
- `raw_data/`: Contains raw experimental measurements.
- `processed_data/`: Contains cleaned and processed versions of experimental data ready for analysis.

### Theory/
- Various `.mat` files containing theoretical calculations of optical properties.

### effective-depth.ipynb
- Jupyter Notebook that processes AFM and experimental data to compute effective depth parameters for optical simulations.
- Note: Please add introductory markdown cells explaining the notebook steps for clarity.

### yagce.csv
- CSV file listing optical constants for Ce:YAG.

## How to reproduce the analysis

1. Open `effective-depth.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the cells to process experimental data and calculate effective depth parameters.
3. Use MATLAB to inspect `.mat` files and compare theory with experimental results.

## Software requirements

- Python 3.x
- numpy, pandas, matplotlib
- MATLAB R2020a or newer
- Jupyter Notebook

## Notes

- `.DS_Store` and `.ipynb_checkpoints/` files are automatically generated and not relevant to the project.
- Some assumptions (such as simulation parameters and experimental conditions) are described in the main text of the publication.
- Additional metadata (e.g., AFM acquisition settings) could be added for completeness.
