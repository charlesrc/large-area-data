# Figure 2 â€“ Light Extraction Enhancement

This folder contains experimental and theoretical data used to generate Figure 2 in the paper
_"Large-scale self-assembled nanophotonic scintillators for X-ray imaging"

## Folder Structure
- `Experiment/EL/`: Electroluminescence (EL) data (structured sample)
- `Experiment/IL/`: Incident Light (IL) data (flat/unstructured sample)
- `Theory/EL/`: RCWA simulations for structured EL samples
- `Theory/IL/`: RCWA simulations for IL samples
- `Benchmark/`: Benchmark between experiment and theory

## Quick Start
1. Run `make_figure2.m` to reproduce all plots automatically if MATLAB is available.
2. Alternatively, run each script separately following the order:
    - Extract line profiles from `raw_EL_image_sample1.tif` and `raw_IL_image_sample2.tif`.
    - Plot theoretical RCWA results using `For_figure_2_sample1.m` and `For_figure_2_sample2.m`.
    - Benchmark experimental vs theoretical profiles using `benchmark.ipynb`.

## Notes
- All experimental raw images are TIFF format and examples are included.
- All RCWA simulations assume normal incidence, TE polarization, refractive indices detailed inside `simulation_notes.md` files.
